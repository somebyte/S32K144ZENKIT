# S32K144ZENKIT
Useful code to work with MCU s32k144
First of all for making a bootloader via linux tty (UART)

dirs
----
docs  - various documents to explain what is happening and what need doing :-)
evb   - examples of srec files for testing the kit on S32K144EVB
linux - source code of linux programs for exchanging between linux and mcu
mcu   - source code to make S32K144 firmwares

scripts
-------
s32_bootload.sh
s32_sys.sh
s32_tty.sh
All scripts make symbolic refs to corresponding contents of mcu directory.
It needs for working with codes from IDE projects.

evb

evbterminal_0x0000B000.srec        - firmware for testing the kit with S32K144EVB over tty (uart);
hello_clocks_blue__0x0000B000.srec - firmware blinks blue  light of S32K144EVB; 0x0000B000 - fw begin address into P-Flash
hello_clocks_red___0x0000F000.srec - firmware blinks red   light of S32K144EVB; 0x0000F000 - fw begin address into P-Flash
hello_clocks_green_0x00013000.srec - firmware blinks green light of S32K144EVB; 0x00013000 - fw begin address into P-Flash


linux
-----
ttydebug - very simple control terminal for mcu via linux tty (over UART)
uploader - program for uploading fw srec files to mcu via linux tty (over UART)
