# S32K144ZENKIT
Useful code to work with MCU s32k144

dirs
----
docs  - various documents to explain what is happening and what need doing :-)
evb   - examples of srec files for testing the kit on S32K144EVB
linux - source code of linux programs for exchanging between linux and mcu
mcu   - source code to make S32K144 firmwares

scripts
-------
s32_bootload.sh
s32_sys.sh
s32_tty.sh
All scripts make symbolic refs to corresponding contents of mcu directory.
It needs for working with codes from IDE projects.
