Sometimes,
if you made own firware as srec-file and uploaded it,
you can see in your debugger something like that:
	No source available for "<signal handler called>() at 0xfffffff9"
           OR
        WDOG-HANDLED-INTERRUPT

Probably of all your srec is wrong, but you can fit it like this:
	sudo apt-get install srecord
	srec_cat yourwrong.srec -obs=16 -o yourfix.srec

Now, upload yourfix.srec
